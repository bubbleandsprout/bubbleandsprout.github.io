    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In collaboration with <a href="https://hereforyouforthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="color:grey">HERE for you for them</span></a></em></p><p>We live in a world that offers endless possibilities for us to compare ourselves to others. But do we as parents really help our children by modelling comparison as a coping strategy? </p><a id="more"></a><p>Before the insurgence of social media, parents’ exposure to fellow parents was limited to the school gate and family gatherings with established friends. Not that these two didn’t occasionally trigger stress hormones. But modern-day parents have the added luxury of 24-hour access to all the perfect parents across the world. How lucky are we!?!</p><p>As far as comparisons go, we seem to have two choices. Downward comparison is a method to help boost our sense of wellbeing by contrasting ourselves with those who are worse off. Who doesn’t remember their parents telling them about all the hungry children in the world who would be very happy with those vegetables? I, for one, recall how this guilt trigger added a rather bitter taste to my greens.</p><p>Upward comparison, on the other hand, is very popular in situations where we feel or are made to feel overwhelmed by others’ apparent strengths that we ourselves lack. Let’s again reach back to our childhood and evoke one of those moments where you were invited to wonder why other children weren’t behaving as badly as you. Remember how helpless this made you feel?</p><p>Psychologists would no doubt confirm that both types of comparison are human strategies that help us deal with threats, build resilience and establish identity. And yes, it does indeed make sense for us to establish where exactly we stand in various social environments. But what other, perhaps even better, technique could we employ instead of this often rather unkind variety?</p><p>We evidently do a lot of thinking about our life and about how it holds up in comparison to other people’s lives. Regrettably, a great deal of our thoughts appear to be critical. Rather than reacting to a situation with the flawed strategy of comparison, it makes sense for us to assimilate and model to our children a response that is kind to both our self and others. This is where the mindful practice of gratitude could help. Gratitude feeds contentment because it is sourced from within and does not need others as a benchmark.</p><p>So how can we introduce ourselves and our children to this kinder alternative coping mechanism? Through trial and error, our family has come up with an – almost – daily gratitude ritual that works both for us and our 8- and 6-year-old. While enjoying our evening meal, each family member gets to share one thing they are the least grateful for and three things they are the most grateful for. The setup is pretty informal, but the one strict rule is that nobody is allowed to interrupt or comment, unless advice is asked for. </p><p>We have consciously included the one ‘sorrow’ because we feel it is important for our children to know that in order to be content and blossom you do not have to be happy all the time. An unexpected bonus of this inclusion of sorrows is that it provides a platform where uncomfortable subjects can be brought up.</p><p>In our experience, the family gratitude ritual we have landed on offers the perfect moment to cherish the positives in our own personal lives, without the need for comparison. An opportunity to bring grace to sorrows and occasionally even learn from them. A beautiful evening ritual to revel in unbiased support for negative things and communal joy for positive things.</p><p><em>With many thanks to Dana Dyskterhuis and Jen Armstrong for giving me the opportunity to post my musings on their platform. It has been a real privilege to get to know these two elegantly powerful ladies at <a href="https://hereforyouforthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="color:grey">HERE for you for them</span></a> and to be playing an ongoing part in OM:POP - their Mindful Kids &amp; Families Pop-Up Events.</em></p>]]></content>

There is something very homely and grounding about brewing a hot drink before a new beginning. </p><a id="more"></a><p>And it doesn’t even stop at beginnings. I will also gravitate towards our stove-top kettle whenever I feel the need to take myself away from a situation, a thinking pattern or an activity. A cuppa to mark an ending or at least a break.</p><p>My husband is surprised by the amount of tea I manage to drink in a day, and equally by the number of half-empty tea cups he finds around our home. So I thought I would try and find out why exactly I brew so much tea (green or herbal depending on the time of day), by drawing up a list of circumstances in which I find myself drawn to the kettle on our hob:</p><ul><li>First thing upon waking</li><li>Before I sit down to write </li><li>As a planned pause</li><li>To think things over</li><li>At a writing impasse</li><li>After lunch with a square of dark chocolate</li><li>Walking in from the cold after running errands</li><li>When a friend visits for a chat</li><li>Before I plan my yoga classes</li><li>After school pickup to share a pot with the kids</li><li>When the kids are safely tucked in bed and I’ve kissed them goodnight</li><li>…</li></ul><p>The list is by no means exhaustive, but it does show that in its essence my personal tea ceremony is not so much about the tea as about the occasion. Waiting for the water to boil. Opening the scented tea caddie. Spooning loose petals or flowers in the strainer. Pouring freshly boiled water in the mug or pot. Allowing the tea enough time to work its magic. </p><p>They are all ceremonial acts in an occasion to remove myself from the fast pace of life. Each cup that I brew throughout the day represents a punctuation mark that offers me a mindful pause in which to focus on the moment and come home within myself.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes! We have finally said goodbye to the four builders who spent the past nine weeks refurbishing our small London home. While most of our belongings were safely tucked away in a dust-free storage cube down the road, we were to waltz around settling clouds of dust before bedding down for the night.</p><a id="more"></a><p>At 7.30, like clockwork, the four men would arrive on our patio. We had to time our kitchen sink wash just right to avoid making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the four-men crowd. Sometimes there were five or even six, if the job of the day required extra hands. When it came to leaving at the end of the day, they were a little less punctual. But usually we would have the building site back to ourselves from around 4.30 in the afternoon.</p><p>Normally, whenever I am not teaching or presenting away from home, I tend to return to write, study, practise and spend time with the kids after school. I love the simplicity and warmth of being at home. It is the place that makes me feel safe, that fosters my physical and mental wellbeing. It is where I practise yoga, which grounds me. It is where I meditate, which allows me to grow. So where was I to find home when the physical space that represented my habitual home, was constantly invaded by strangers and loud noises? </p><p>During the past nine weeks, a large chunk of my non-teaching time was spent in comfortable coffee shops with fashionable hot drinks. I would go for a swim followed by a sauna and a proper wash at the gym. There was my friend’s cozy place to which she had given me the key so I could make myself at home during the day. Or I would simply choose to wander through the London streets and discover new places. How lucky was I? Yet this lack of a familiar home still managed to cause me some degree of stress.</p><p>On one such ‘forced’ London wandering, I happened across the Choose Love shop in Soho and was drawn in by their tag line: “Imagine a world where you can shop your heart out, leave with nothing and feel great about it.” A mindful minimalist’s dream! Choose Love (<a href="https://choose.love/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://choose.love/</a>) turned out to be a pop-up shop with gifts that could make a real difference to someone’s life.</p><p>There are approximately 65 million people in the world today who are literally forced to leave their home, and this without the prospect of ever returning. These are people who have been driven out of their home and country due to persecution, war or violence. Their leaving was not a choice. Nor do they have access to warm coffee shops, hot showers or their friends’ cozy homes. Imagine the degrees of stress they must be experiencing. It simply makes sense to buy gifts that don’t come home with us but are sent directly to the uprooted refugees who truly need them. What’s not to love about that?</p>]]></content>

After all, it will release toxins, reduce stress and reset our mind. Secondly – and obviously more to the point within the context of this post – do we even realise what we are saying here? Acting ‘like a man’ makes you stronger? Crying ‘like a girl’ shows weakness? Surely we should know better by now?</p><p>And now feels like exactly the right time to consider what true strength actually means to us. Let’s start rooting for an attitude that includes such qualities as elegance, compassion, intuition and even imperfection. Our current society already has more than its fair share of bullying masculinity on display. Can we honestly continue to make our children believe that strength is purely expressed by flexing excessively developed muscles? Can we seriously condone intimidation and force as the ultimate methods to make a difference?</p><p>Here’s to a whole new way of showing strength, starting with the shameless promotion of femininity.</p>]]></content>

Or do I relentlessly tell them what to do to try and make our household run ‘smoothly’? </p><p>Apparently I have occasionally been subscribing to the philosophy of Servant Leadership. Little did I know that there is, in fact, an official title for my attempt at leading the kids by following them. Unfortunately, most parents these days have a negative reaction to being called their kids’ servant. So how about, in this context, we call it Humble Leadership?</p><p>A humble leader is someone who aims to empower their followers. It is amazing how well a humble approach is received by our children. When they feel empowered to lead the way, they will also happily follow. When they feel empowered to express their opinions, they will also respect ours. When they feel empowered to try something new, they will learn from the mistakes they may experience.</p><p>Scientists are becoming increasingly aware of the strong correlation between our breath’s rhythm and our mental well-being. So if we were to expand on our analogy, it would make sense to learn to follow our kids’ rhythm a little more often and let intuition lead reasoning.</p>]]></content>

One of the main differences between then and now seems to be the loss of our appetite for quality. We no longer buy with the intention for our clothes to last. When a jumper has a hole, we simply buy another one. </p><p>There doesn’t even have to be anything ‘wrong’ with the jumper per se. Being out of fashion tends to be a valid enough reason to allow it to be forgotten. To me, this all boils down to a lack of appreciation for the maker, for their craft and for our natural resources. </p><p>Luckily we are witnessing a growing social and environmental awareness that is making people more conscious of their clothes’ makers and materials. And this is where I see the ideal opportunity to reintroduce the skill of mending. I don’t mean to say that we all have to become experts at seamless repairing. In fact, I personally strongly subscribe to the Japanese tradition of kintsugi, which celebrates our items’ history by consciously making any mends visible.</p><p>These days, my husband, my children and I can be seen wearing crocheted elbow and knee patches like badges of honour. Out of love and respect for my two late grannies, I have found a way to marry both of their skills by carefully patching up holes using crochet squares and rectangles.</p>]]></content>

Suitcases landed straight from the London pavements on the carpet. The kettle was put on the hob to brew a pot of tea next to the empty vases. And before I knew it, dinner time had arrived and eight people were sitting around our very small kitchen table sharing a mezze of Indian takeaway dishes.

But for now, I’d like to remain focused on why a capsule wardrobe truly deserves to be popular.</p><a id="more"></a>  <p>Fortunately for the cause of the minimal wardrobe, some very successful, high-profile individuals, such as President Obama, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs, are associated with wearing the same outfit every day. For me, a much lower profile yoga teacher, fashion decisions are naturally limited. A pair of leggings, a vest, and I’m good to go. Still, I know that plenty of people in my social circle would feel very self-conscious about wearing the same thing day in, day out. It is a real shame that we are so caught up in this cultural habit of sartorial variety. After all, most of our kids (in Britain, at least) wear the same thing to school every day.</p><p>The school uniform is effectively the ultimate capsule wardrobe. Presumably the fundamental idea behind it is to create a sense of belonging and pride in one’s scholarly identity. But we, parents and children alike, are experiencing many additional arguments in favour of this uniform capsule:</p><ul><li>Fewer decisions in the morning with more time for what truly matters (like a healthy breakfast)</li><li>Smart, appropriate attire guaranteed (without arguments)</li><li>Less clutter due to fewer clothes</li><li>Cheaper than trying to keep up with the trends</li><li>No peer pressure or competition with lower risk of bullying</li></ul><p>Agreed, quite a few school uniforms could be better designed and made. But hey, most of us have surely outgrown at least the need for our school uniform by now. So here’s the exciting news: We are now mature enough to carefully curate our own uniform in keeping with our personal sense of fashion, body shape and lifestyle. Combined with the above benefits, what’s not to like?</p>]]></content>
